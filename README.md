# Software project management documents

This is currently only a working repository / home for:
* ["A practical guide to research software project estimation" by Chase Million](https://github.com/MillionConcepts/software_project_management/blob/main/practical_software_estimation/a_practical_guide_to_research_software_project_estimation.pdf)

With an expectation of more to follow later when I get around to it.
